/**
Protocol for handling pre-roll video advertising.

 When an object conforming to this protocol is assigned to a `VPKPreview` or `VPKVeepViewer`, VPKit video content will be loaded and paused to allow the host app to manage preroll advertising.
 
 `view`, `controller` and `completion` objects will be returned to facilitate correct handling and display of prerolls.
 
 When the `completion` block is called, control will return to the SDK to play the requested video content.
 
 Designed for [GoogleAds Interactive Media Ads](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/ios/client-side/) requirements.

 @param     controller    The parent viewController for the `view`. This is the viewController that must be used

 @param     completion    The completion block that must be called when the preroll ad has finished playing. The VPKit SDK video will not play until this block is called.
